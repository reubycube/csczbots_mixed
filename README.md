# CS:CZ Bots (Mixed difficulty and voices)

Playing around with some additional configuration for the Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Bots

The configuration adds the "VoiceBank" paramater on some of the Bot Profiles.

## How to use
Place both the BotProfile.db and FBotChatter.db into the "...\steamapps\common\Half-Life\czero" folder

Create the "fbot" folder under the "...\steamapps\common\Half-Life\czero\sound\radio" folder. Place the sound files in there. (I look around on Gamebanana for a Female Bot Voice Pack CS
